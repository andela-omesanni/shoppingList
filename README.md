SHOPPING LIST (4TH ANDELA PROJECT)


********************************************  DESCRIPTION ************************************************************

This project was about creating a javascript based shopping list. Users will be able to add new items to their shopping
list. When an item has being added, the users will be able to check off items that they've already done and can also be
able to delete items from their shopping list. The styles for checked off items are different from ones that haven't been
checked off.
